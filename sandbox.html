  <I>Working Note</I>
<p>Thus the primary aim of the doctrine is to reduce the expense of determining boundaries both by allowing the parties to determine their own boundaries, thus avoiding expensive inquires, and by enforcing the agreement the parties arrive at,thus eliminating the cost of recourse to the courts. In order to reduce the costs
of dispute settlement, finality of the decision arrived at by the parties must be encouraged. It is not enough simply to protect the actual reliance by the parties on the line. Not only would litigation be required to determine the degree and nature of the reliance, but, more important, if only actual reliance on an agreed line were protected, it would still be necessary to have recourse to the courts to settle the line itself.</p>
